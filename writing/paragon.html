        <h2 id="sampletitle" class=title>Chapter 1</h2>
         <p>
            The groans and rumbles of the ship reminded Scotty of the hurricane that had hit the family farm when he was a boy. Hiding in a small hay bale in the big red barn behind the house with his brother, he thought he'd learned the meaning of terror that afternoon. But of course the word was redefined when the Tek arrived. That big red barn burning in the early morning light, billowing smoke across the fields - which his remaining family members now lived beneath - was the first of an immeasurable amount of destruction the invaders brought. "Caleb." He murmured to himself as he gripped the vibrating arms of the pilot's chair tighter. He tried not to think about those he'd already lost, and the others he was leaving behind. But he couldn't help wonder how much longer they would make it without him if the plan failed, and whether they knew he was still alive, or what he would be giving for them.
            <br>
            <br>
            An alarm began to sound in the cockpit accompanied by a flashing green light, the source of which Scotty couldn't quite pinpoint. The strange controls that sat in-front of him began to raise and separate either side, causing him to experience a momentary heart attack as one of the signature masks of the Tek revealed itself from within. He had never seen what their faces really looked like, but the masks alone were enough to make him skip a breath. Scotty reached for the mask and lifted it, cautiously lowering it over his head. His senses were assaulted with foreign inputs, all but one unrecognisable - The trademark clicks and croaks of Tek vocalisations. He couldn't tell if one of those things was trying to communicate with him, or if the sounds had been pre-recorded, but he knew they wouldn't be best pleased when they discovered he'd escaped and taken one of their sky-ships. He could see the ship's interior around him through the mask, or at least the outlines of the shapes that made it up, filled with a shifting blue-green colouration which brightened the darkest crevices and darkened the brightest reflections. Is this how they see? How they hunt us down like rats? The controls began to glide through the air towards him, seemingly unaided by any kind of machinery. They wrapped around the middle of three symmetrically laid out chairs where he had chosen to place himself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tentatively, he reached for the controls while murmuring to himself "Charlie, you better've been right about this." After all this whole plan had been his uncle Charlie's idea, and he'd given his own life to ensure it went into motion. Having intently studied the Tek's coming and goings while imprisoned with Scotty, Charlie had supposedly seen how they got these sky-ships off the ground, and how they readied them for transport. Trouble was, uncle Charlie had never quite been all there, at least in Scotty's opinion, and the invasion had tipped him far over the edge. Nevertheless, this was the only plan Scotty had, and he intended to follow it through - With or without faith. Without in this case. The takeoff had worked at least, now all that remained to be seen was whether Scotty could fly the ship into the Hirah - A monolithic tower the Tek had landed out of the sky amidst the invasion, and which they seemed to base their operations from. It could be seen from half the way around the globe, or so they said in the news before communications, and life as Scotty knew it, had ended.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of his trembling hands wrapped around a misshapen control stick that vibrated along with the ship, and his other hovered above a set of six hexagonal plates laid out in a circular pattern, which appeared to be made of a glass-like material. Pull the farthest left stick back, towards yourself, and put your right hand on the hexagonal plate - Uncle Charlie's words echoed in Scotty's mind. But which plate? there are six! He sucked up a deep breath, as deep as he could through the mask's filtration system, and dropped his hand on the left-most panel while pulling back hard on the stick. The panel illuminated in a soft blue-tinted white colour, which to Scotty appeared the same shade of blueish green as everything else, and the sky-ship roared furiously as it was suddenly propelled sideways through the air.
            <br>
            <br>
            The acceleration almost sent Scotty flying about the cockpit, but he kept himself stuck to the pilot's chair by wrapping his ankles around two nooks in it's lower half. "This doesn't seem right!" He yelled to himself, panicking as he smacked at the remaining 5 hexagonal plates. They each lit up in turn, the same as the first, and the ship began to twist and spin uncontrollably. Scotty's legs weakened, and eventually gave out. He was flung from the chair, accidentally pulling the control stick to the left before losing his grip and crashing into a separate set of controls along the back wall of the cockpit. The ship began to rise rapidly, straight upward into the tar-black clouds, and it's gyration stabilised. Scotty reached upward for something to support himself on and tried to pull himself up off of the floor. He heard a worrying thunk as the bar he had fumbled for and pulled upon moved downward a few inches, settling into a new position.
            <br>
            <br>
            Suddenly the ship ceased vibrating completely, and for a moment Scotty thought he was about to fall out of the sky. Until he turned his head toward the ceiling-to-floor screen that showed outside the front of the ship and saw a small floating orb, no more than two or three feet across. "What in the hell is THAT?" The orb flattened and began to stretch outward in all directions, until it were taller, and wider than the ship itself. Scotty felt his stomach drop at the magnitude of what was now a flat disc that floated in-front of the ship. Before he had long to think, the disc began to peel outward from the center, revealing a spiraling maelstrom of what appeared to be stars. Scotty was awe-struck. He hadn't seen stars since the Tek covered earths skies in thick, smoke-like clouds - which never recessed. He had hoped to see them once again, but under very different circumstances.
            <br>
            <br>
            The sky-ship once again began to rattle as the vibrations ramped upward. "No, wait… Not again!" Scotty jumped forward, grabbing hold of the back of the pilot's chair, preparing himself for another wild ride. The ship lurched forward, but this time quickly settled into a slow glide, right toward the whirlpool of stars inside the floating disk. As the rumbling continued to rapidly increase in intensity, Scotty held his breath and shut his eyelids tight, bracing himself for whatever was coming. He didn't know what to expect, but still it surprised him when the floor beneath him seemed to give way. Instinctively he tightened his arms around the chair and found his arms squeezing through nothing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Reluctantly he opened his eyes and saw nothing around him. No more chair, no more controls, no more ship. He was floating limp like a ragdoll in an empty void that appeared to expand around him endlessly. Scotty reached for his head and pulled off the Tek mask. As he dropped it in-front of him, it too faded out of sight - He was glad to see it gone. He let out his held breath and felt an unfamiliar, rhythmic vibration in his lungs and throat as it escaped his nostrils. "Wh-at is ha-pp-en-in-g?" His voice trembled like his breath and the rhythm resonated deeply through his body. His eyelids began to feel heavy. He fought them from closing, thinking it would be the end for him, but he could only fend off the inevitable for so long. He felt his body begin to rise upward through the void, and just before his eyelids closed shut he thought he saw the big red barn from behind his families home, and heard the winds of the hurricane ripping planks from it's walls. As his eyelids sealed shut everything but the sound of the wind faded, and the rising sensation became one of falling.
            <br>
            <br>
            In what felt like an instant, his eyes reopened. He saw blue skies, dotted with the same fluffy white clouds he had remembered as a boy. His hair shook violently across his face, but he could see well enough to notice the birds. The first he had seen in so many years. Then he noticed that his body was engulfed by a wispy yellow aura that streamed off of his feet as he fell. I'm upside down. He began to jerk and twist in the air to rectify his position but froze when he saw what was beneath him - A large body of water and a small island, on which a giant tower identical to the Hirah sat, it's topmost segment shining a deep red beacon across the water - All of which was rapidly approaching. Yet again his entire body tensed and he held his breath, bracing for impact. He penetrated the water near the island head-first but felt nothing. No force of impact, not even the cold.
            <br>
            <br>
            The speed at which Scotty had fallen sunk him deep into the murky water. He couldn't see more than a few feet in-front of him, but the tower beacon's red light penetrated the surface in solid beams, guiding him upward. He swam toward it and the yellow aura began to fade away. He started to feel wet, and the cold seeped in. His arms and legs were seizing and his breath was running short, but he made it just in time. As his head broke the surface he gasped for air and flailed his arms about for something to grab hold of. The sharp edges of untamed grass slipped between the fingers of his right hand, and with a tug he threw his other arm over the embankment of dirt, which surrounded the small island. The water was too cold for him to stay soaking in and take a moment to catch his breath, so Scotty wriggled and pulled himself up frantically, sliding through mud and coating his now tattered prisoner's garb from the chest down.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally on land, albeit far from dry, Scotty's arms wobbled and gave out. He flopped onto his back and laid staring into the sky, attempting to catch his breath. He saw something moving in the clouds above him. Another bird? No, it was falling too. He saw the same yellow aura that had surrounded him now trailed off of the unidentified object as it burst through the clouds, falling from the sky towards the island. It's falling fast, whatever it… Realising it was coming straight toward him, Scotty threw his body to the side, and with not a moment to spare. He rolled onto his stomach and smothered his face into the ground, covering it with dirt as the thing smashed into the ground where he previously laid. A rain of mud flew into the air, splashing Scotty and dirtying the few patches of his dark hair that had managed to remain un-soiled. He wiped his hands on the chest of his jacket and lifted his head, looking to the small impact crater and wiping at his eyes to clear his vision. The Tek mask sat in the center, completely clean with a slight yellow wisp evaporating away like steam. "Of course it followed me. How could I have been so foolish as to think I'd seen the last of it?" Scotty let out a half-hearted chuckle and pushed himself up to his knees, his arms still shaking with fatigue.
            <br>
            <br>
            The tower's now asynchronously pulsing red beacon drew Scotty's eyes toward the Hirah-like structure. From ground level he started to notice some variations from the tower that had been leering over him for the past twelve years, and although still unsettling, he felt a slight comfort in not being able to spot the real Hirah anywhere. It wasn't just the Hirah, there were no sky-ships droning overhead searching for him and his kin. And the black sky that he had become so reluctantly accustomed to was nowhere to be seen. Where the hell am I? Did we win already? No, that doesn't make any sense, I just escaped one of the camps.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once Scotty was done begging himself for answers he did not have, he began to look around at his immediate surroundings. The mud that he knelt in extended past him another fifteen or so feet before transitioning into what was probably once a rather luscious underbrush but now seemed only a mess of tangled, dying plant-life, littered with finger-length thorns. Beyond that was a clearing of yellow-brown unkempt grass which stood between one to two feet tall, and stretched thirty feet, almost the entire way to the base of the tower. This all seemed normal to Scotty, the plant-life around the Hirah he knew had also reportedly been killed by it's presence, but the similarities began to end there. At the base of the tower large blackened wood spikes stuck out of the ground, pointing away from the tower and sharpened to a point. They reached halfway up the first segment of the tower, twenty or thirty feet high, but seemed far too primitive to be anything related to the Tek. Energy beams, forcefields, the Tek had many methods of keeping humans in or out of things, but never had they been known to use pointy sticks. It was hard for Scotty to make out too many details of the tower itself from here, and he'd never actually been this close to the Hirah he knew, but he had heard a lot about it from various news sources, as well as other prisoners. Though whether they were to be trusted or not he couldn't say. He looked behind him over the water. It was a long way to the nearest piece of land, seemingly multiple miles. The water rippled reflections of the shining sun over-head and appeared to become clearer the further away from the island he looked. Scotty knew he couldn't make the swim. Not in that cold water, and probably not in the most luxurious of temperatures either. Months of imprisonment had left him weakened, and he was already so fatigued from the escape attempt. The only way to go was in-land, toward the tower. Fortunately, whatever alien material his prisoner's garb had been made from appeared to dry off much faster than he expected, and he could already feel the sun's warmth making it's way through the light-weight clothing. Unfortunately, it didn't appear to have magical dirt-removing properties, and he was caked in the stuff. Scotty thought about dipping his head into the water to rinse off his face and clean out his hair, but the embankment was too high and he didn't want to risk falling back into the water. It had taken enough of an effort to get out the first time, and he wasn't sure he'd make it to the tower if he had to do it again. He looked to the looming tower, his destination, and then back down the small crater at the Tek helmet and sighed. I suppose it might come in useful. He thought to himself as he crawled over and begun to slide down the crater walls on his behind. I couldn't wait 'til I never saw one of these again, now I'm fetching one! Scotty couldn't help but chuckle at the irony as he picked up the immaculately clean headpiece. The Tek had taken so much from him, but they wouldn't have his sense of humour. At least that's what he told himself, and it did in-fact make him feel better. He took a strip of his trouser leg that had been partially ripped off and used it to tie the helmet to his hip, then crawled on his hands and knees back out of the crater. I hope they're okay. He allowed himself that final thought of home before marching onward towards the tower, only it wouldn't be the last.
