        <h2 id="sampletitle" class=title>Day 0</h2>
         <p>
                There I was, my eyes glowing blue, thick streams of vapour wafting out of 'em; I'd been hitting the dust something fierce. It was long past twilight and I'd found myself in The Gilded Goblin for one or two quick games of Crabhandle. 'Course it soon became five or six, then nine or ten. Before I knew it, my shard pouch was almost empty, and my throat was drier than a desert nymph's fenticle. The other wasters at my table were lucky I'd decided to play fair.
                <br>
                <br>
                I slipped away from my comrades in cards, who's antics had been relegated to the darkest corner of the room, and wormed through the crowd of drunkards and schmoozers toward Manny, the owner of the fine establishment. He wasn't easy on the eyes, big bulbous nose seemed to grow bigger each time I saw him, but he gave me a pass on the dust; a good guy, that Manny.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Manwell," I shouted over the merrymaking, pawing at the light pouch fastened under my coat. "Hows about one on the house, huh?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "C.J. you scum bucket," His thick western accent was as welcoming as ever. "You want a drink in my tavern, you pay just the same as e'ryone else." He stood tall, a good six inches taller than myself, and much wider, with his meaty forearms crossed over his chest.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Manny," I said "Manny, have you forgotten already how I so charitably tracked the devious Derinals who burgled you just two fulls back?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Nay. And I've not forgotten the amount I paid you for it. Nor how many handouts you've tried for since." A good guy, that Manny. Stern as ever, that's what I liked about him. "One for a mug, Three for a pitcher; Same as always."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Alright, you've sold me." I pulled three shards out of my pouch, lighter still, and stacked them neatly on the bar between us. "Some of your famous spiced mead, please and thank you." He scoffed as he grabbed clumsily at the shards and turned to get me my drink.
                <br>
                <br>
                While I waited for the big man's return I took the opportunity to scan the tavern. It was business as usual for The Gilded Goblin. Not the fanciest joint in the city, far from it, but I'd been to worse dives in my time in Arteris. A few of the patrons whose gazes I caught quickly turned back to their booze. Must be the eyes, I thought. Folks are always put off by the eyes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Business as usual, except that something was off. My intuition was tingling but I couldn't put a finger on it. Ah, too much dust maybe, or I'm just feeling jumpy. I usually took my instincts more seriously, but truth be told it had been a rough week.
                <br>
                <br>
                Manny slammed a pitcher on the bar behind me; Almost made me jump through my skin. "Well, thanks, Manny." I took a big gulp straight from the jug. "Be seein' ya."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Hold on," He said. "I gotta question for you."
                <br>
                <br>
                I took the drink away from my gullet for a moment to respond. "I'm all ears, boss."
                <br>
                <br>
                Manny leaned over the bar, lowering his voice. "You heard anything 'bout the beast?" A look of concern coated his lumpy face.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Manny," I said. "Manny, Manny. Afraid of rumours now?" I waved my hand in dismissal.
                <br>
                <br>
                "S'no rumour." His head shook slowly. "Been six bodies out there."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Bodies, but no sign of any beast. It's probably just some madman, same as always." He must be getting old, I thought. Old and fearful to believe in whispers of nonsense. Mind you, he was only five years my senior, but old age is a mindset, and Manny had it.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Why don't you go lookin' into it, eh?" His expression lightened. The man didn't like me, but he sure as nether knew I could get the job done. "Would put a lot of folks 'round 'ere at ease."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Sorry to break your heart, Manny, but I don't work for free." I fingered my shard pouch, still light as ever. "Somebody puts up some chips, maybe I'll get involved. Until then it's the guard's business."
                <br>
                <br>
                His hope turned to disappointment. "I thought you might say as much." Almost made me feel bad for the old timer, but I knew he'd be alright. Word was the madman had only targeted woman; Nightwenches, mostly. The dangers of the trade.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought to throw the big man a little jab, lighten his mood. "You'll be fine." I told him. "I heard your beast is looking for love, and you've naught to offer his sensibilities."
                <br>
                <br>
                "You little prick, C.J." He retorted with a smirk, holding back laughter. "Get back to your drink." Old Manny had a sense of humour after all.
                <br>
                <br>
                Drink it was. I needed it to calm my still tweaking nerves, and there were matters of Crabhandle to attend. I'd grown tired of the scant weight that hung at my hip; the time for fair play was over.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I returned to my table the other gents were finishing a round. Crack timing, I thought. "You in?" The dealer nodded to me, shuffling a deck in grubby hands as I took my seat facing the corner.
                <br>
                <br>
                "I am," I pointed around to each one of them in turn, while reaching under my coat with my left hand. "and you'd all better be ready to cough up when I pull aces." I pulled out my shard pouch, and emptied it's contents onto the centre of the table. "All or nothin'."
                <br>
                <br>
                The table eyed me with curious contempt. The young fella next to me, red-haired lad with an off-white shirt split to his belly, picked up his shards and pushed his stool away from the table; Smart boy. The others threw in their lot. Cards slid across the table, face down, two a piece. I lifted my cards and leaned back in my chair, balancing it on two legs, and resting my feet on the table. Three of diamonds, and nine of hearts; Nothin', but it didn't matter.
                <br>
                <br>
                While the dealer threw out the next lot of cards, the door to the tavern flew open, bashing into the wall, and letting in a nasty cold from the mud-soaked streets outside. It's bad manners to let a tavern door swing wide, every drunk in Arteris knows that. Now who's the asshole that wishes us all frozen to death, I thought. The door slammed shut, and I took my card.
                <br>
                <br>
                My ears twitched. Light footsteps accompanied the sound of creaking floorboards approaching my direction from behind. I wouldn't have noticed, had I not been so on edge. A lady, or a child. It had to be, and there were no children here at this hour. The fellas sitting opposite me looked past my head with wide eyes, and loose jaws. I shot a glance over my shoulder, and that's when I first saw her.
                <br>
                <br>
                She was beautiful, a real keeper. Her white-gold hair peaked from under a finely hemmed hood, which cast a light shadow over her perfectly sculpted face; a caliber of architecture which shamed the commoners who littered her surroundings. She wore clothing that marked her as a wealthy woman, but she was too young to have earned it. A noble? I asked myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                The steps of her slender legs planted softly under concealing garments, making her seem to glide rather than walk; a grace only heard of in tales of faerie and fey. I was transfixed, like my soon-to-be marks. She crossed the room heading directly for me, staring down at her feet to avoid contact with the locals.
                <br>
                <br>
                She set herself down on the empty stool beside me and looked up, timidly meeting my gaze, showing me a reflection in her bright green eyes. The sight of my own mug snapped me out of the daze. I remembered the last time a shifty stranger approached me as intently while I sat with a handful of cards, and the scar their dagger left in my gut.
                <br>
                <br>
                She was beautiful, but beauty can prove a deadly distraction.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Mr Spurlock?" She asked with a hint of desperation, like I was the last stop on a long journey.
                <br>
                <br>
                "That's me." I said, snapping my fingers at the dealer and pointing to the deck he bent in idle hands. "How'd you know?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Tied black hair with white streaks, a heavy brown coat pierced by a raven-head broach, and glowing blue eyes." She said softly, with the unmistakable accent of Arteris' rich and powerful. "One silver-edged rapier with runic inscriptions notwithstanding, you appear as they say you do, sir."
                <br>
                <br>
                She was shy, The Gilded Goblin wasn't her kinda spot and it showed, but the dame had done her research. I got the feeling she wasn't looking to cut me open; not yet anyway. "Call me C.J., doll." I offered her a smile, and a card came my way. One game continued, nearing it's end, and another was just beginning.
