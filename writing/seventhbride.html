            <p class="story">
                There I was, my eyes glowing blue, thick streams of vapour wafting out of 'em; I'd been hitting the dust something fierce. It was long past twilight and I'd found myself in The Gilded Goblin for one or two quick games of Crabhandle. 'Course it soon became five or six, then nine or ten. Before I knew it, my shard pouch was almost empty, and my throat was drier than a desert nymph's fenticle. The other wasters at my table were lucky I'd decided to play fair.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I slipped away from my comrades in cards, who's antics had been relegated to the darkest corner of the room, and wormed through the crowd of drunkards and schmoozers toward Manny, the owner of the fine establishment. He wasn't easy on the eyes, big bulbous nose seemed to grow bigger each time I saw him, but he gave me a pass on the dust; a good guy, that Manny.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Manwell," I shouted over the merrymaking, pawing at the light pouch fastened under my coat. "Hows about one on the house, huh?"
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "C.J. you scum bucket," His thick western accent was as welcoming as ever. "You want a drink in my tavern, you pay just the same as e'ryone else." He stood tall, a good six inches taller than myself, and much wider, with his meaty forearms crossed over his chest.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Manny," I said "Manny, have you forgotten already how I so charitably tracked the devious Derinals who burgled you just two fulls back?"
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Nay. And I've not forgotten the amount I paid you for it. Nor how many handouts you've tried for since." A good guy, that Manny. Stern as ever, that's what I liked about him. "One for a mug, Three for a pitcher; Same as always."
                
                "Alright, you've sold me." I pulled three shards out of my pouch, lighter still, and stacked them neatly on the bar between us. "Spiced mead, please and thank you." He scoffed as he grabbed clumsily at the shards and turned to get me my drink.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                While I waited for the big man's return I took the opportunity to scan the tavern. It was business as usual for The Gilded Goblin. Not the fanciest joint in the city, far from it, but I'd been to worse dives in my time in Arteris. A few of the patrons whose gazes I caught quickly turned back to their booze. Must be the eyes, I thought. Folks are always put off by the eyes.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Business as usual, except that something was off. My intuition was tingling but I couldn't put a finger on it. Ah, too much dust maybe, or I'm just feeling jumpy. I usually took my instincts more seriously, but truth be told it had been a rough week.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Manny slammed a pitcher on the bar behind me; Almost made me jump through my skin. "Well, thanks, Manny." I took a big gulp straight from the jug. "Be seein' ya."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Hold on," He said. "I gotta question for you."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I took the drink away from my gullet for a moment to respond. "I'm all ears, boss."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Manny leaned over the bar, lowering his voice. "You heard anything 'bout the beast?" A look of concern coated his lumpy face.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Manny," I said. "Manny, Manny. Afraid of rumours now?" I waved my hand in dismissal.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "S'no rumour." His head shook slowly. "Been six bodies out there."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Bodies, but no sign of any _beast. _It's probably just some madman, same as always." He must be getting old, I thought. Old and fearful to believe in whispers of nonsense. Mind you, he was only five years my senior, but old age is a mindset, and Manny had it.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "And what of the howlin'?" He asked.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Never seen a stray dog in Arteris? Manny, my friend, you need to get out more."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Why don't you go lookin' into it, eh?" His expression lightened. The man didn't like me, but he sure as nether knew I could get the job done. "Would put a lot of folks 'round 'ere at ease."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Sorry to break your heart, Manny, but I don't work for free." I fingered my shard pouch, still light as ever. "Somebody puts up some chips, maybe I'll get involved. Until then it's the guard's business."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                His hope turned to disappointment. "I thought you might say as much." Almost made me feel bad for the old timer, but I knew he'd be alright. Word was the madman had only targeted woman; Nightwenches, mostly. The dangers of the trade.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I thought to throw the big man a little jab, lighten his mood. "You'll be fine." I told him. "I heard your beast is looking for love, and you've naught to offer his sensibilities."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "You little prick, C.J." He retorted with a smirk, holding back laughter. "Get back to your drink." Old Manny had a sense of humour after all.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Drink it was. I needed it to calm my still tweaking nerves, and there were matters of Crabhandle to attend. I'd grown tired of the scant weight that hung at my hip; the time for fair play was over.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                When I returned to my table the other gents were finishing a round. Crack timing, I thought. "You in?" The dealer nodded to me, shuffling a deck in grubby hands as I took my seat facing the corner.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "I am," I pointed around to each one of them in turn, while reaching under my coat with my left hand. "and you'd all better be ready to cough up when I pull aces." I pulled out my shard pouch, and emptied it's contents onto the centre of the table. "All or nothin'."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The table eyed me with curious contempt. The young fella next to me, red-haired lad with an off-white shirt split to his belly, picked up his shards and pushed his stool away from the table; Smart boy. The others threw in their lot. Cards slid across the table, face down, two a piece. I lifted my cards and leaned back in my chair, balancing it on two legs, and resting my feet on the table. Three of diamonds, and nine of hearts; Nothin', not that it mattered.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                While the dealer threw out the next lot of cards, the door to the tavern flew open, bashing into the wall, and letting in a nasty cold from the mud-soaked streets outside. It's bad manners to let a tavern door swing wide, every drunk in Arteris knows that. Now who's the asshole that wishes us all frozen to death, I thought. The door slammed shut, and I took my card.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                My ears twitched. Light footsteps accompanied the sound of creaking floorboards approaching my direction from behind. I wouldn't have noticed, had I not been so on edge. A lady, or a child. It had to be, and there were no children here at this hour. The fellas sitting opposite me looked past my head with wide eyes, and loose jaws. I shot a glance over my shoulder, and that's when I first saw her.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She was beautiful, a real keeper. Her white-gold hair peaked from under a finely hemmed hood, which cast a light shadow over her perfectly sculpted face; a caliber of architecture which shamed the commoners who littered her surroundings. She wore clothing that marked her as a wealthy woman, but she was too young to have earned it. A noble? I asked myself.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The steps of her slender legs planted softly under concealing garments, making her seem to glide rather than walk; a grace only heard of in tales of faerie and fey. I was transfixed, like my soon-to-be marks. She crossed the room heading directly for me, staring down at her feet to avoid contact with the locals.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She set herself down on the empty stool beside me and looked up, timidly meeting my gaze, showing me a reflection in her bright green eyes. The sight of my own mug snapped me out of the daze. I remembered the last time a shifty stranger approached me as intently while I sat with a handful of cards, and the scar their dagger left in my gut.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She was beautiful, but beauty can prove a deadly distraction.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Mr Spurlock?" She asked with a hint of desperation, like I was the last stop on a long journey.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "That's me." I said, snapping my fingers at the dealer and pointing to the deck he bent in idle hands. "How'd you know?"
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Tied black hair with white streaks, heavy brown coat pierced by a raven-head broach, and glowing blue eyes." She said softly, with the unmistakable accent of Arteris' rich and powerful. "One silver-edged rapier with runic inscriptions notwithstanding, you appear as they say you do, Ravenhound."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She was shy, The Gilded Goblin wasn't her kinda spot and it showed, but the dame had done her research. I got the feeling she wasn't looking to cut me open; not yet anyway. "Call me C.J., doll." I offered her a smile, and a card came my way. The game continued, another was just beginning.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Right… C.J." She shifted uncomfortably, didn't seem to like the way I looked at her. I figured she'd be used to it, thought she must get a lot of attention.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "So, what you need?" I asked her.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She looked awkwardly around the table before answering. "If it's alright with you Mist… I mean C.J., I'd rather speak of it in private."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                'Course she would. Idiot, I thought. Supposed to be the professional, and there I was asking her to spill it in-front of a crowd that she didn't know. Guess I got so caught up in the stunt I was about to pull that I wasn't thinking straight; Needed another hit of dust, that would've gotten me clocked. "Sure, doll." I said, pushing aside the mistake on my part. "Give me a minute to take these guys' shards, and we'll move the conversation elsewhere."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The guys didn't like that much. "What you tryna pull?" One of them protested.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Nothin', nothin'." I replied casually, rolling up my sleeve with my free hand, slyly brushing the rune tattoo'd on the underside of my forearm. "Just Inguiz-in' ya, I mean teasin' ya."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Inguiz; A useful incantation for a cheat. The bastard wizard Braxart might've kicked me out of the academy, but I learned a few tricks before he had the chance. The cards I held changed at my will. What had been an ironically rotten hand became a sure win in seconds. Who needs luck when you've got magic.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The final cards were dealt. I didn't check, just picked mine up and deposited it into the hand. "What did I tell ya fellas?" A smirk grew across my face and I stood, slapping my cards down on the table. "Royal pots. Cough it up."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "That's bollocks!" One of the guys shouted, pointing an accusatory finger across the table and looking to his buddies. "Oi, he done cheated!" He was dirty, gaunt, and his teeth rotted in his mouth; probably needed the chips more than me.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Oh please," I waved a dismissive hand. "Inspect them for yourself." I pushed the cards further onto the table, and wrapped my hand around the pile of shards.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "I said that's bollocks!" The guy pushed his stool over as he stood, pulling a dagger from under his goat-skin coat. The others at the table stared at the cards, dumbfounded. They bought it.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Easy, tough guy." I raised my hands. "Not in-front of the lady, huh?" She was scared-stiff, poor dame.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                His buddies talked him down, lucky guy, things could've gotten messy. I pocketed the shards, not as many as I'd hoped for, and pulled the lady away by the arm, pitcher of mead in the other hand.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I flashed two fingers over to Manny, and took a seat with the lady at an empty table, away from the crowd. One of his maids brought two glasses over. She placed one by the lady, and unceremoniously slammed the other in front of me. It was Henrietta, a curvy young dame I'd pissed off on more than a few occasions.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I pulled one of her long, curled, black hairs out of the mug, and tossed it aside. "Didn't spit in it did'ya?" I asked her.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Be glad I didn't piss in it, C.J." She turned to the lady. "Careful, hon', thisn's a right gillie," She looked back at me, anger burning in her eyes. "And a no-good bedswerver!"
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                My face met the naturally tawny beige palm of her hand with a hard slap. I watched her leave, stomping back over to the bar.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She's not wrong, I thought. Not wrong at all.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Long way from home, your… friend." The lady said.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "From Bergia, I think." I said as I scooped an ice cube out of my glass, and held it against my reddened cheek. "Fled something, didn't ever tell me what. Nice girl." I poured each of us a drink, and slumped back in my chair. "So, then. What's a doll like you doing, looking for a snoop like me, in a place like this?"
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She didn't touch her drink. Just stared at the glass like she didn't know what to do with it. "It's my father." She said. Sounded like she'd been waiting to speak it out loud for a while.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "What about him?" I asked.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Once again she made eye contact, and I could see myself reflected in her irises. Pretty young girl lookin' at me like she'd found something she needed brought back a lot of memories; painful memories. I needed a hit, but Manny'd be on my ass if I dusted up in plain sight.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "He's missing." She said, snapping me out of it. "Neither me, nor my mother have seen him for weeks."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Poor girl. Can't say I understood, but she seemed real torn up about it. "You both must be worried."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "I am." She said, looking longingly down to her glass. There's nothin' to be found at the bottom of that, I thought. "I've five thousand shards to offer if you find him. On top of your retainer, of course."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I tried to keep a straight face, almost spat a mouthful of mead over her. Five bags; that's alotta chips. "When do I start?" I asked.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Visit me at the family estate on the morrow. My mother and I shall be available for questioning," She spoke of her mother with a dose of vitriol, like the word tasted of ashes on the way past her soft, red lips. Made me awful curious. "and a contract ready for signing."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "You never gave me your name, doll." I said, leaning forward onto the table.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Dunhall." She said. "Cecelia Dunhall."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Cecelia. The name suited her. "And the estate?" I asked.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Upper Rimhold, west of the gardens." She reached into her pocket, and pulled out a handkerchief with an emblem on it; a rosebud surrounded by twisting thorns. "Our family crest."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Nice neighborhood." That was an understatement. Rimhold was home to half of the nobles in Arteris. How could someone so important have been missing for so long, and how hadn't I heard of them before.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I saw tears welling up in Cecelia's glistening eyes and found myself unexpectedly reaching out for her hand; drawn to it. I wanted to offer some semblance of comfort, but she shriveled away and stood, turning toward the tavern door to leave.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "I'll find him." I told her.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She paused for a moment, "I dearly hope that you do, Mr. Spurlock." and then she was gone. Left me with nothin' but the handkerchief and a full glass to remember her by.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "C.J." I said to myself, frowning at the feeling of bewildering emptiness her departure had left in the room. "Told her to call me C.J."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I saw the skinny guy from before still eyeing me from the across the room, fiddling with his dagger under the table, and by this point my eyes were emitting only the slightest dull blue glow. Time to get out of here, I thought. So I necked both glasses, grabbed the handkerchief, and headed for the door.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I stopped by the bar and asked Manny where Henrietta was.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "She's gone, C.J." He said, making a pile of mugs under the counter. "Just left for the night."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Shame." I said. "Wanted to see if I couldn't smooth things over." She was still a touch heated over our last rendezvous, and I felt bad about it.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                She was a nice girl after all. Not the type I'd settle down for, but good for a few trips around the block. Sooner or later I'd have let her go to a more chivalrous suitor, who would give her what I never could.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I need a hit, I thought.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Back tomorrow evenin'." Manny said. "Can catch 'er then, if she'll let ya."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "She will." I said to myself as I slipped out of the door, throwing Manny an unanswered salute.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                It was cold outside, as it often was at night in Arteris. The type of cold that cut deep into your flesh. The cobblestone road under my feet was half concealed by a thick mist. Who's genius idea was it to build a city floating in the sky, I thought.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I slipped a pipe out of my waistband, and a dust pouch from the inside right pocket of my coat. As I loosened the strings, the smell of dust escaped the pouch in a cloud of joy, or was it folly? Either way I couldn't wait to spark up, and clock in.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                After a few light taps, I stuffed the pouch of blue glory back into it's designated pocket. I rubbed the tattoo on the thumb of my right hand with my index finger and muttered aloud "Zinul." A small flame spouted out of the end of my thumb, which I held to the pipe; another little trick.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I sucked in the first puff of sweetness and tilted my head up to the sky, exhaling a thick blue cloud littered with white sparkles. It dissipated to reveal the moon, shining big and bright in the sky, cut in half by a fast moving, thin cloud.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Already my nerves were starting to settle. I felt the vapours starting to tease their way past my eyes. No longer was I thinking about Henrietta, nor that skinny fella with the attitude, and especially not Cecelia Dunhall and her missing father.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Things're alright, I thought, and I set off, heading for my room at the Wanderlust Hotel. It was to be a long walk through the east district. "Now if only I could find that bird!" I said loudly to the night, and she appeared, same as always.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                A raven, black as the night sky, swooped gracefully from a nearby rooftop and landed on my shoulder. "There you are, Fletch." I said, scratching at the feathers on top of her little head.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                "Kaugh!" She twisted her neck, nuzzling into the palm of my hand.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Fletch. My partner, my confidant, my closest friend. If naught else, she was always with me, latched on at the coil of my mortality; the greatest trick in a drop-out's arsenal.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The streets were quiet. It was late, but recent rumours had kept even the night-stalkers of Arteris locked up inside. I strolled confidently down Main Street, yappin' to Fletch about my spat with Henrietta, and the beautiful Cecelia who'd shown up lookin' for me. I could tell she was excited about tomorrows trip to Rimhold; such high rooftops there.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                At the intersection of Main and Clifvern we heard a sudden shrill scream in the distance, which was quickly cut short. All kinds of no good goes on in those parts of Arteris. Not my business, I thought. That's for the guard.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                As if they heard me thinking, a patrol of the city guard clopped down the street, heading my way from up ahead; bunch of dewdroppers. Half of 'em were more bent than the goons who ran the outer districts, and the other half too incompetent to realise it. This particular group clung to their side swords like they were itching to run somethin' through. The only thing I hate more than a gangster, is a corrupt bull.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I slipped down a side alley and cut past the intersection. Besides my dislike for the lot of 'em, I thought it best to avoid the guard with my eyes freshly steaming. Dust was illegal in Arteris, though I could never figure why. The stuff is mostly used by crotchety old men - wizards - to keep 'em focused while reading boring, old books; an aspect of study I often skipped out on during my years at the academy. Suppose it had more to do with the regular unattuned folks that caught a puff, and lost their marbles in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I popped out of the alleyways on Millermond Avenue; not the route I'd planned to take, but things rarely go to plan. The breeze died down for a moment, so I went to take another puff. As the blue cloud escaped my lips I caught something in the corner of my eye, which without dust-enhanced senses I might've missed entirely.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Out of the alleyway opposite, a small stream of crimson liquid flowed through the cracks in the cobblestone. It was blood, no mistaking it. I tucked away my pipe and approached. Old habits die hard.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The stench of death assaulted my nostrils; I'd been around it enough to know. Slumped against the wall, in a twisted heap of torn skin and viscera, was a once beautiful Bergian broad. Blood-soaked black curls dripped from her head, which hung from the neck by a strained slither of sinew.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Henrietta. "Ah, shit."
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Fletch cocked her head and looked at me, a faint chatter clicking in her throat. She recognised the dearly departed. I didn't know what to tell her.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I knelt down beside the corpse to take a closer look. I hadn't seen any of the madman's previous victims, but it seemed the rumours of their condition weren't all that inflated; real grisly work he'd done to her. I was, of course, assuming it to have been the killer Manny had asked me about, lest there be more than one deranged dame killer on the streets of Arteris; a possibility I didn't much like to consider.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Aside from the areas that her flesh had been rended wide open, Henrietta's clothing was mostly intact. I found a small amount of solace in the fact that she had kept her sanctity in death.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Clenched in her right hand, so hard that it left a bruise of like shape in her palm, was a small bronze amulet she had always carried with her; from from Bergia, I think - The only thing she still had from home. The wooden beads that had once adorned its twine were scattered across the floor around her.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I took the amulet. If the guard didn't snatch it, the taker would. Better that I keep it for now, I thought. Tucked it safely into the inside left pocket of my coat, and stood back up.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I dusted myself off, and just as I thought to go another round on the pipe the light in the alley failed me. Thick clouds drifted in-front of the moon, and a hair-raising howl echoed through the streets of the east district; louder than any ten wild dogs combined.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Fletch jumped to attention, and so did I. "What in the nether…" I uttered against my will.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                My surprise was cut short; clopping boots drew toward the alley from multiple directions. The guard, late as always. If I hadn't wanted them seeing me before, I definitely didn't want them finding me now, not here. I took one last look at Henrietta, or what was left of her, and thought of all the things I could've said, should've said.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                I flicked Fletch up into the sky to guide me through the alleys without being seen, and split.
