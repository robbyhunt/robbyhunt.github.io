			<p class="story">
				There I was, my eyes glowing blue, thick streams of vapour wafting out of 'em; I'd been hitting the dust
				something fierce. It was long past twilight and I'd found myself in The Gilded Goblin for one or two quick games
				of Crabhandle. 'Course it soon became five or six, then nine or ten. Before I knew it, my shard pouch was almost
				empty, and my throat was drier than a desert nymph's fenticle. The other wasters at my table were lucky I'd
				decided to play fair.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I slipped away from my comrades in cards, whose antics had been relegated to the darkest corner of the room, and
				wormed through the crowd of drunkards and schmoozers toward Manny, the owner of the fine establishment. He
				wasn't easy on the eyes - big bulbous nose seemed to grow bigger each time I saw him - but he gave me a pass on
				the dust; A good guy, that Manny.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Manwell," I shouted over the merrymaking, pawing at the light pouch fastened under my coat. "How about one on
				the house, huh?"
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"C.J. you scum bucket." His thick western accent was as welcoming as ever. "You want a drink in my tavern, you
				pay just the same as e'ryone else." He stood tall, a good six inches taller than myself, and much wider, with
				his meaty forearms crossed over his chest.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Manny," I said. "Manny, have you forgotten already how I so charitably tracked the devious Derinals who burgled
				you just two fulls back?"
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"I've not forgotten the amount I paid you for it. Nor how many handouts you've tried for since." A good guy,
				that Manny. Stern as ever, that's what I liked about him.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Three for a mug, eight for a pitcher. Liquor's extra; same as always."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Alright, you've sold me." I pulled four shards out of my pouch, lighter still, and stacked them neatly on the
				bar between us. "Colton on the rocks, please and thank you." He scoffed as he grabbed clumsily at the shards and
				turned to get me my drink.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				While I waited for the big man's return I took the opportunity to scan the tavern. It was business as usual for
				The Gilded Goblin. Not the fanciest joint in the city - far from it - but I'd been to worse dives in my time in
				Arteris. A few of the patrons whose gazes I caught quickly turned back to their booze. Must be the eyes, I
				thought. Folks are always put off by the eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Business as usual, except that something was off. My intuition was tingling but I couldn't put a finger on it.
				Ah, too much dust maybe, or I'm just feeling jumpy. I usually took my instincts more seriously, but truth be
				told it had been a rough week.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Manny slammed a glass down on the bar behind me; almost made me jump through my skin. I took a big gulp and
				sucked my tongue as I turned to take my leave.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Hold on," he said. "I gotta question for ya."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I took the drink away from my gullet for a moment to respond, but before I got the chance Manny leaned over the
				bar and asked in a lowered voice, "you heard anything 'bout the beast?" A look of concern coated his lumpy face.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Manny," I said. "You're afraid of rumours now?" I waved my hand in dismissal.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"S'no rumour." He shook his head slowly. "Been six bodies out there in as many weeks."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Bodies, but no sign of any beast. It's probably just some madman, same as always." He must be getting old, I
				thought. Old and fearful to believe in whispers of nonsense. Mind you, he was only five years my senior, but old
				age is a mindset, and Manny had it.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"And what of the howlin'?" He asked.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I told him he needed to get out more. Streets of the outer districts are always littered with wild mutts after
				all.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Why don't you go lookin' into it, eh?" His weighted expression lightened. The man didn't like me, but he sure
				as nether knew I could get the job done. "Would put a lot of folks 'round 'ere at ease."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Sorry to break your heart, Manny, but I don't work for free." I fingered my shard pouch, still light as ever.
				"Somebody puts up some chips, maybe I'll get involved. Until then it's the guard's business."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				His hope turned to disappointment. "I thought you might say as much." Almost made me feel bad for the old timer,
				but I knew he'd be alright. Word was the madman had only targeted women; the type to linger at the corner of
				Bollard and Vine long past sundown. Dangers of the trade.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I thought to throw the big man a little jab, lighten his mood. "You'll be fine," I told him. "I heard your beast
				is looking for love, and you've nought to offer his sensibilities."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"You little prick, C.J." He retorted with a smirk, holding back laughter. "Get back to your drink." Old Manny
				had a sense of humour after all.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Drink it was. I needed it to calm my tweaking nerves, and there were matters of Crabhandle to attend. I'd grown
				tired of the scant weight that hung at my hip; the time for fair play was over.
				When I returned to my table the other gents were finishing a round. Crack timing, I thought. "You in?" The
				dealer nodded to me, shuffling a deck in grubby hands as I took my seat facing the corner.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I pointed around to each one of them in turn, reaching under my coat with my left hand. "Get ready to cough up
				when I draw aces." I pulled out my shard pouch and emptied its contents onto the centre of the table. "All or
				nothin'."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The table eyed me with curious contempt. Young fella next to me, red-haired young man with an off-white shirt
				split to his belly, picked up his shards and pushed his stool away from the table; smart boy. The others threw
				in their lot. Cards slid across the table, face down, two apiece. I lifted my cards and leaned back in my chair,
				balancing it on two legs, and resting my feet on the table. Three of diamonds, and nine of hearts. Nothing in
				it, not that it mattered.
				While the dealer threw out the next round of cards, the door to the tavern flew open, bashing into the bar, and
				letting in a nasty cold. It's bad manners to let a tavern door swing wide, every drunk in Arteris knows that.
				Now who's the asshole that wishes us all frozen to death, I thought. The door slammed shut, and I took my card.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Light footsteps accompanied the sound of creaking floorboards approaching my direction from behind. I might not
				have noticed, had I not already been so twitchy. A lady, or a child. It had to be, and there were no children
				here at this hour. The fellas sitting opposite me looked past me with wide eyes and loose jaws. I shot a glance
				over my shoulder - that's when I first saw her.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She was beautiful, a real keeper. Her white-gold hair peeked from under a finely hemmed hood, which cast a light
				shadow over her perfectly sculpted face; a calibre of architecture which shamed the commoners who littered her
				surroundings. She wore clothing that marked her as a wealthy woman, but she was too young to be self-made. A
				noble? I asked myself.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The steps of her slender legs planted softly under concealing garments, making her seem to glide rather than
				walk; a grace only heard of in tales of faerie and fey. I was transfixed, as were my soon-to-be marks. Hell,
				half the room seemed to be watching her as she drifted toward me, staring down at her feet to avoid contact with
				the locals.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She set herself down on the empty stool beside me and looked up, timidly meeting my gaze, showing me a
				reflection in her bright green eyes. The sight of my own mug snapped me out of the daze. I remembered the last
				time a pretty woman pulled up a chair beside me, and the scar their dagger left in my gut.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She was beautiful, but beauty can prove a deadly distraction. Besides, people don't go around looking for me for
				no good reason, and if she wanted a job done she'd be off-limits.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Rule no. 3 - No fraternising with clients.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Mr Spurlock?" She asked with a hint of desperation. Like I was the last stop on a long journey.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I snapped my fingers at the dealer, pulling him out of a dream he had no business dreaming, and pointed to the
				deck he bent in idle hands before turning my attention back to the newcomer. "How'd you know?" I asked her.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Tied black hair with white streaks, heavy brown coat pierced by a raven-head broach, and - glowing blue eyes."
				She said softly, with the unmistakable accent of Arteris' rich and powerful. "One silver-edged rapier with old
				symbols inscribed along its hilt notwithstanding, you appear as they say you do, Ravenhound."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She was shy, The Gilded Goblin wasn't her kinda spot and it showed, but the dame had done her research. I got
				the feeling she wasn't looking to cut me open; not yet anyway. "Call me C.J, doll." I offered her a smile and
				another card finally came my way.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				One game drifted close to its end, another was just beginning.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She shifted uncomfortably, didn't seem to like the way I looked at her. I figured she'd be used to it, thought
				she must get a lot of attention.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"So, what sends a dame like you looking for a snoop like me?" I asked her.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She looked awkwardly around the table before answering. "If it's alright with you Mister Spur - C.J., I'd rather
				speak of it in private."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				'Course she would. Idiot, I thought. Supposed to be the professional, and there I was asking her to spill it in
				front of a crowd that she didn't know. Guess I got so caught up in the stunt I was about to pull that I wasn't
				thinking straight; needed another hit of dust, that would've gotten me clocked. "Sure, doll," I said, pushing
				aside the mistake on my part. "Give me a minute to take these guys' shards, and we'll move the conversation
				elsewhere."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The guys didn't like that much. "What you tryna pull?" One of them protested.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Nothin', nothin'," I replied casually, rolling up my sleeve with my free hand and slyly brushing the rune
				tattooed on the underside of my forearm. "Just Inguiz-in' ya, I mean teasin' ya."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Inguiz; A useful incantation for a cheat. The bastard wizard Braxart might've kicked me out of the academy, but
				I learned a few tricks before he had the chance. The cards I held changed at my will. What had been an
				ironically rotten hand became a sure win in seconds.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Who needs luck when you've got magic, and a nasty dust puffing habit to power it.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The final cards were dealt. I didn't check, just picked mine up and deposited it into the hand. "What did I tell
				ya fellas?" A smirk grew across my face and I stood, slapping my cards down on the table. "Royal pots. Cough it
				up."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"That's bollocks!" One of the guys shouted, pointing an accusatory finger across the table and looking to his
				fellow lowlifes for support. "Oi, he done cheated!" He was dirty, gaunt, and his teeth were rotting in his
				mouth; probably needed the chips more than me.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Oh please," I waved a dismissive hand, "inspect them for yourself." I pushed the cards further onto the table
				and wrapped my hand around the pile of shards.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"I said that's bollocks!" The guy pushed his stool over as he stood, pulling a dagger from under his goat-skin
				coat. The others at the table stared at the cards, dumbfounded. They bought it; I knew they would.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Easy, tough guy." I raised my hands, half in jest. "Not in front of the lady, huh?" She was scared stiff, poor
				dame.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				His buddies talked him down, lucky guy, things could've gotten messy. I pocketed the shards - not as many as I'd
				hoped for - and pulled the lady away by the arm, last sips of my drink in the other hand.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I flashed two fingers over to Manny and took a seat with the lady at an empty table, away from the crowd. One of
				the bartenders brought two glasses and a bottle over. She gently placed one glass by the lady, and
				unceremoniously slammed the other in front of me. It was Henrietta, a curvy young dame I'd pissed off on more
				than a few occasions.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I pulled one of her long, curled, black hairs out of the mug, and tossed it aside. "Didn't spit in it did'ya?" I
				asked her.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Be glad I didn't piss in it, C.J." She turned to the lady. "Careful, hon', thisn's a right gillie," She looked
				back at me, anger burning in her eyes. "And a no-good bedswerver!"
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				My face met the tawny beige palm of her hand with a hard slap. I watched her leave, stomping back over to the
				bar.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She's not wrong, I thought. Not wrong at all. I found myself staring after her a moment too long, wondering if
				things could've been any different between us.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Long way from home, your - friend." The lady said.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"From Bergia, I think," I said as I scooped an ice cube out of my glass, and held it against my reddened cheek.
				"Fled something, didn't ever tell me what. Nice girl." I poured us both a drink and slumped back in my chair.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She didn't touch hers. Just stared at the glass like she didn't know what to do with it. "It's my father," she
				blurted out. Sounded like she'd been waiting to speak it out loud for a while.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				We caught each other's gaze, and I could see myself reflected in her irises. Pretty young girl looking at me
				like she'd found something she needed, and Hen letting me have it like she did, brought back a lot of memories.
				I needed a hit, but Manny would be on my ass if I dusted up in plain sight.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"What about him?" I asked, trying to focus through the withdrawal.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"He's missing," she said. Her eyes welled up and her voice began to wobble. "Neither me, nor my mother, have
				seen him for weeks."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Poor girl. Can't say I understood, but she seemed real torn up about it. "You both must be worried."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"I am," she said, looking longingly down to her glass. There's nothin' to be found at the bottom of that, I
				thought. "I've five thousand shards to offer if you find him. On top of your retainer, of course."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I tried to keep a straight face, almost spat a mouthful of hooch all over her. Five bags; that's a lotta chips.
				"When do I start?" I asked.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Visit me at the family estate on the morrow. My mother and I shall be available for questioning." She spoke of
				her mother with a dose of vitriol. Like the word tasted of ashes on the way past her soft, red lips. Made me
				awful curious. "I'll have Bastion draw up a contract ready for signing."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The family estate. "You never gave me your name, doll," I said.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Dunhall." She said. "Cecelia Dunhall."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Cecelia. The name suited her. "And the estate?" I asked.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Upper Rimhold, west of the gardens." She reached into her pocket, and pulled out a handkerchief with an emblem
				on it; a white rosebud wrapped in twisted thorns. "Our family crest."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Nice neighbourhood." That was an understatement. Rimhold was home to half of the nobles in Arteris. I didn't
				think the residents of a place like that could go missing, least not without it being talked about.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I saw tears welling up in Cecelia's eyes again, and found myself unexpectedly reaching out for her hand; drawn
				to it. I wanted to offer some semblance of comfort, but she shrivelled away and stood, turning toward the tavern
				door to leave.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"I'll find him," I told her.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She paused for a moment, "I dearly hope that you do, Mr. Spurlock." And then she was gone. Left me with nothing
				but the handkerchief and a full glass to remember her by.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"C.J." I said to myself, lamenting the emptiness her departure had left at the table. "Told her to call me C.J."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I saw the skinny guy from before - with the goat-skin coat - still eyeing me from the across the room, fiddling
				with his dagger under the table. By this point my eyes were emitting only the slightest dull blue glow, so I
				thought it was about time to get out of there. I necked both glasses, grabbed the bottle and the handkerchief,
				and headed for the door.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I stopped by the bar and coughed up another pile of shards for the bottle, then asked Manny where Henrietta was.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"She's gone, C.J." He said, stacking a pile of mugs under the counter. "Just left for the night."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Shame," I said. "Wanted to see if I couldn't smooth things over." She still seemed a touch heated over our last
				rendezvous, and I felt bad about it.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				She was a nice gal after all. Not that I was the type for settling down, but I thought maybe we could have it
				good again for a while, like it was before. I knew sooner or later I would've had to let her go to a more
				chivalrous suitor, someone who would've given her what I never could, but I wanted one more stint before we both
				got to old.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I need a hit, I thought.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Back tomorrow evenin'," Manny said. "Can catch 'er then, if she'll let ya."
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"She will," I said to myself as I slipped out the door, throwing Manny an unanswered salute.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p class="story" id="center">
				-----
			</p>
			<br />
			<p class="story">
				It was cold outside; always was was at night in Arteris. The type of cold that cut deep, to the bone. The
				cobblestone road under my feet was half concealed by a thick mist. Who's genius idea was it to build a city on a
				giant floating rock? I thought.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I slipped my pipe out of my waistband, and a dust pouch from the inside right pocket of my coat. As I loosened
				the strings, the smell of arcum dust escaped the pouch in a cloud of joy. I couldn't wait to spark up, and clock
				in.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				After a few light taps, I stuffed the pouch of blue glory back into it's designated pocket. I rubbed the tattoo
				on the thumb of my right hand with my index finger and muttered aloud "Zinul." A small flame spouted out of the
				end of my thumb, which I held to the pipe; another little trick.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I sucked in the first lungful of sweet serenity and tilted my head up to the sky, exhaling a thick blue cloud
				littered with white sparkles. It dissipated quickly, making way for the moon, shining big and bright in the sky.
				I watched for a moment as it was sliced in half by an isolated thin cloud.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The fullness of the moon marked the start of the seventh week of the Nightswell. Seven weeks, each starting with
				a full moon, leading up to the Crimsoncall; a full day of night where the moon shines the colour of blood,
				bathing the whole city in dull red light.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				My nerves were already starting to settle. I felt the vapour starting to tease its way past my eyes being wicked
				away with the wind. No longer was I thinking about Henrietta, nor that skinny fella with the attitude, and
				especially not Cecelia Dunhall and her missing father. Things're alright, I thought. And I set off, heading for
				my room at the Wanderlust Hotel.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				It was to be a long walk through the east district. "Now if only I could find that bird!" I said loudly to the
				night, and she appeared, same as always. A raven, black as the night sky, swooped down from a nearby rooftop and
				landed on my shoulder. "There you are, Fletch," I said, scratching at the feathers on top of her little head.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				"Kaugh!" She twisted her neck, nuzzling into the palm of my hand.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Fletch. My partner, my confidant, my closest friend. If nought else, she was always with me, latched on at the
				coil of my mortality; the greatest trick in a drop-out's arsenal.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The streets were quiet. It was late, but recent rumours had kept even the night-stalkers of Arteris locked up
				inside. I strolled confidently down Main Street, yapping to Fletch about my spat with Henrietta, and the
				beautiful Cecelia who'd shown up looking for me. I could tell she was excited about tomorrows trip to Rimhold;
				such high rooftops there.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				At the intersection of Main and Clifvern we heard a sudden shrill scream in the distance, which was quickly cut
				short. All kinds of no good goes on in the outer districts of Arteris. Not my business, I thought. That's for
				the guard.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				As if they heard me thinking, a patrol came clopping down the street, heading my way. Bunch of dewdroppers. Half
				of 'em were more bent than the goons who ran the outer districts, and the other half too incompetent to realise
				it. This particular rabble clung to their side swords like they were itching to run something through. The only
				thing I hate more than a gangster is a corrupt bull.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I slipped down a side alley and cut past the intersection. Besides my dislike for the lot of 'em, I thought it
				best to avoid the guard with my eyes freshly steaming. Dust was illegal in Arteris, though I could never figure
				why. The stuff is mostly used by crotchety old men - wizards - to keep 'em focused while reading boring, old
				books; an aspect of study I often skipped out on during my years at the academy. Suppose it had more to do with
				regular folks without a tolerance who caught a puff and lost their marbles in the process.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I popped out of the alleyways on Millermond Avenue; not the route I'd planned to take, but things rarely go to
				plan. The breeze died down for a moment and I stopped to take another puff. As the blue cloud escaped my lips I
				caught something in the corner of my eye, which without dust-honed senses I might've missed entirely. Out of the
				alleyway opposite, a small stream of crimson liquid flowed through the cracks in the cobblestone. It was blood,
				no mistaking it. I tucked away my pipe and approached. Old habits die hard.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				The stench of death assaulted my nostrils; I'd been around it enough to know. With brief hesitation, I peeked
				into the alley. Slumped against the wall, in a twisted heap of torn skin and viscera, was a once beautiful
				Bergian broad. Blood-soaked black curls dripped from her head, which hung from the neck by a strained slither of
				sinew.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Henrietta. I let out a nasty curse or two under my breath.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Fletch cocked her head and looked at me, a faint chatter clicking in her throat. She recognised the dearly
				departed. I didn't know what to tell her.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I knelt down beside the corpse to take a closer look. Hadn't seen any of the madman's previous victims, but the
				rumours of their condition turned out closer to reality than I'd expected; real grisly work he'd done to her. I
				assumed this to be the latest work of the killer Manny had asked me about, lest there be more than one deranged
				dame killer on the streets of Arteris; a possibility I didn't much like to consider.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Clenched in her right hand, so hard that it left a bruise of like shape in her palm, was a small bronze amulet
				she had always carried with her; from Bergia, I think - The only thing she still had from home. The wooden beads
				that had once adorned its twine were scattered across the floor around her.

				I took the amulet. If the guard didn't snatch it, the Taker would. Better that I keep it for now, I thought,
				before I tucked it safely into the inside left pocket of my coat.

				Next to the body sat Henrietta's blood-spattered purse. Believe it or not, I first thought to leave it be; give
				the girl some privacy in death. That is until I noticed an enticing piece of parchment poking it's head through
				the purses opening. I slipped what was then revealed to be a letter out without touching the bag, and unfolded
				it for a quick look.

				Ah, Hen. Looks like she'd found her chivalrous suitor after all. But trees in Arteris? Must be some type of
				code, I thought. I took a moment to run through my memory, but I couldn't put a name to the initial. Not one
				which made any sense anyway. I decided to hold onto the letter - couldn't help but wonder whether it had been
				inked by Hen's killer. Admittedly emotional reasoning, but either way, you never know what's important before
				you piece it all together.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I picked myself back up to two feet and noticed one last thing; Hen's left leg was gone. I missed it at first -
				it was hard to tell with the body the way it was - but nowhere among the mess was there any sign of the tattoo
				which wrapped around her thigh.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I pat myself down and got to thinking about going another round on the pipe before taking another look around,
				when I heard rustling behind me. I spun around, reaching a hand behind my back for my dagger. The shadow of a
				man wearing a paneled flat cap stretched across the wall as he ran down another side alley.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Another curse escaped me. I dropped Henrietta's bag - still open - on the ground and lifted my foot to make
				chase. A thick cloud drifted in front of the moon, leaving only a slight glow from the street to light the
				alleys, and a sudden hair-raising howl followed from nearby.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Fletch's talons gripped into my shoulder as I stopped, frozen in place. "What in the nether," I uttered against
				my will.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Then - almost like they were answering me - a chorus of Arteris' wild dogs began an unscheduled performance.
				Howls echoed through the streets from all directions.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I'd be lying if I said I wasn't taken aback, but my surprise was cut short. Clopping boots drew toward the alley
				from behind me; the guard, late as always. If I hadn't wanted them seeing me before, I definitely didn't want
				them finding me now; Not here. Whoever took off down that alley had gotten away. I could only hope I hadn't let
				the bastard who did this go.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				I took one last look at Henrietta - or what was left of her - and thought of all the things I should've said,
				then flicked Fletch into the sky to guide me through the alleys, and split.
